Gaussian naive bayes
*Real-wolrd applicatin:  mark an email as spam or ham.

*the strengths of naive bayes: it's very easy to implement cause it based on assuming conditional independence among features.

*the weakness of naive bayes: when you use Naïve Bayes classification algorithm with a small data set the precision and recall will keep very low.

*I think it's good cause census it  not very small to make reliable estimations of the probability of each class.
